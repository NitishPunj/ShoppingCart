# ShoppingCart

## Introduction: 
ShoppingCartApp  is a  test project app which consumes a RESTful API to demonstrate a shopping cart application. 

## Functionality
List of products
Add to cart
Remove from cart

## Architecture
In this project I have demonstrated my knowldege of VIPER pattern which is used to apply the concepts of SOLID  principles. We can test each component separately using mocks and this improves the overall testability of code and also makes bug fixing easier in the long run. 

### Todo:
Wishlist functionality using persistence framework

## Buiild Notes
Build with Xcode: Version 11.3.1 
Target Device: iOS, iPad : iOS: 13+
